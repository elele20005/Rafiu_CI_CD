## User Story

AS A software engineer looking to integrate a CI/CD pipeline in a codebase
I WANT a full-stack application that runs test cases when a Pull Request is made to the develop branch and automatically deploys to Render when the code is merged to main
SO THAT I can ensure that all code integrations are clean and pass the proper requirements and that the application is constantly updated when major releases are made to the main branch

## Description: MERN stack, React, MongoDB, and Node.js/Express.js server and API, updated with Cypress 

My task is to take starter code and create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to run the component tests via Cypress when a Pull Request is made to the develop branch, and the application is deployed when code is merged from develop to the main branch.

## Installation
To complete the assignment, you'll need to do the following:

Install `Cypress as a dev dependency.`

create a `CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions`

 
## Usage
To use the Rafiu_CI_CD locally you will run:

`npm run build`

`npm run start:dev` Doing this will allow you to open this locally.


## Credits
Initial StarterCode was provided by the edX. The Converting codes were written by me to create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to run the component tests via Cypress when a Pull Request is made to the develop branch, and the application is deployed when code is merged from develop to the main branch. Also with the help from several AI chatbots, incl. the edX AI chatbot, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot. I also watched a lot of Youtube tutorials when debuging issues. Additionally, several YouTube tutorials were referenced to better understand `Cypress`, `MongoDB`, and  `API` structure as well.

## Contribution
No contributions needed at this time - but feel free to download, fork, use, and play with the codes as desired.

## Tests
To test the code, initiate the server by executing the command `npm run start`. Subsequently, open a separate terminal and run the command `npm run test`. This action will execute the component test `Rafiu_CI_CD`.
