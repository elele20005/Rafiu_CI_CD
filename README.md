## User Story

AS A software engineer looking to integrate a CI/CD pipeline in a codebase
I WANT a full-stack application that runs test cases when a Pull Request is made to the develop branch and automatically deploys to Render when the code is merged to main
SO THAT I can ensure that all code integrations are clean and pass the proper requirements and that the application is constantly updated when major releases are made to the main branch

## Description: MERN stack, React, MongoDB, and Node.js/Express.js server and API, updated with Cypress 
## Task Your task is to take starter code and create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to run the component tests via Cypress when a Pull Request is made to the develop branch, and the application is deployed when code is merged from develop to the main branch.

This week task is to take the starter codebase of a fully functioning Tech Quiz application and enhance it by adding Cypress for both component and end-to-end tests. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. This Tech Quiz allows users to answer a series of questions and provides a final score based on the number of correct answers. The project also includes a Cypress folder containing automated test scripts that verify the game's functionality, which can be executed using Cypress or directly from the terminal.

## Installation
To complete the assignment, you'll need to do the following:

Install `Cypress as a dev dependency.`

Configure `Cypress for both component` `and` `end-to-end testing`

Create a `component test for the quiz component.`

Create an `end-to-test` for the `quiz component.`
 
## Usage
To use the Tech Quiz locally you will run:

`npm run build`

`npm run start:dev` Doing this will allow you to open this locally.

Running the command `npm run test` will run the `cypress test` in the terminal.

Running the command `npm run cypress` will open `cypress` and you're able to run the test there.

## Credits
Initial StarterCode was provided by the edX. The Converting codes were written by me by enchancing it by adding Cypress for both component and end-to-end tests. I also watched a lot of Youtube tutorials when debuging issues. Additionally, several YouTube tutorials were referenced to better understand Cypress, MongoDB, and  API structure as well.

## Contribution
No contributions needed at this time - but feel free to download, fork, use, and play with the codes as desired.

## Tests
To test the code, initiate the server by executing the command `npm run server:dev`. Subsequently, open a separate terminal and run the command `npm run test`. This action will execute the component test `Quiz.cy.tsx` as well as the end-to-end test `quiz.cy.ts`. With the server still operational, you may run `npm run cypress`, provided that it is installed. This will launch Cypress, from which you can conduct both the Component and end-to-end tests.
