AS A software engineer looking to integrate a CI/CD pipeline in a codebase
I WANT a full-stack application that runs test cases when a Pull Request is made to the develop branch and automatically deploys to Render when the code is merged to main
SO THAT I can ensure that all code integrations are clean and pass the proper requirements and that the application is constantly updated when major releases are made to the main branch



## Task Your task is to take starter code and create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to run the component tests via Cypress when a Pull Request is made to the develop branch, and the application is deployed when code is merged from develop to the main branch.
